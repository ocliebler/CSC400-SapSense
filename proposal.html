          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            For small maple syrup farms and hobbyists, every drop of maple sap 
            counts. It takes on average 40 gallons of maple sap to make a single 
            gallon of maple syrup. The traditional technology for collecting maple 
            sap is as simple as attaching a bucket to a maple tree and drilling in 
            a tap. For small-scale maple farmers, the labor-intensive part is 
            walking to each bucket and checking to see which buckets need to be 
            emptied. If a bucket overflows, precious maple sap can be lost. This 
            project is to prototype a sensor system that could be used to detect 
            the sap level in a maple bucket to notify the farmer that the bucket is 
            ull. While sensor systems for large-scale maple farms do exist, like the 
            Tap Track system used at Meadowbrook Acres farm 
            [https://www.farmingmagazine.com/maple/sugarmaking-technology-past-present/], 
            there isnâ€™t a solution for small scale bucket farms. The sensor system 
            will use LoRaWAN technology and the Helium network to stay low-cost, 
            perfect for a smaller farm. A similar project has been undertaken in 
            the field of beekeeping: https://www.hackster.io/354300/longhive-12d952 .
          </p>
          <h2>Project Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to create a proof-of-concept to show how 
            a low-power, low-cost LoRaWAN sensor on the Helium network can be used 
            to monitor maple sap collection. 
          </p>
          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>The sensor will be able to be positioned at the fill line on a bucket 
            to detect whether the correct sap level has been reached. It will use 
            very small packets of data to inform the user of the status of the 
            collection bucket. The user will also be alerted via a notification 
            when a full bucket is detected. The user will be able to access the 
            history of the status of the bucket, to see if the bucket has been full 
            for many hours and likely overflowed. This information will be 
            accessible to the user through notifications and a web-based 
            application.</p>
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>The main impact of this project will be specifically on maple sap 
            harvesters, which are often small/hobby farms local to New England 
            and Canada (including southern Connecticut). If scaled-up to a 
            full-sized system with many sensors, this project could significantly 
            reduce the amount of labor-intensive manual checking of a sap 
            harvesting system while still being affordable to implement and easy 
            to maintain. </p>
          <h2>Platform and Technology</h2>
          <p>A Helium hotspot will be used to provide internet connectivity to 
            the sensor (representing the sensor system). The sensors will be 
            assembled using RAKWireless WisBlock kits which the Computer Science 
            department already has. The sensor will include a LoRa component, 
            water sensor, and can also include a GPS component to report its 
            location. The Helium Console will be used during the project to 
            retrieve sensor data especially while the hardware prototype is built. 
            The web application to view the sensor data, and the notifications will 
            access the the Helium console API. Provided that the core features are 
            reached, the web application will also need to include a map to represent 
            sensor status geographically if the GPS capability is introduced.</p>
